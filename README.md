# AstronAuth

A simple authentication solution.

## Goals

Personally, the main goal of this project is for me to learn more about computer security,
OAuth 2.0, and about building bigger projects (hopefully using Kubernetes and Nix).

The project is meant to offer a simplified version of Auth0.
It's meant to provide the back-end for a service
where clients can manage users and their roles.
Thus it will provide endpoints for registration and login for said users,
registration and login for clients,
and management of the users and their roles.

In lieu of a front-end,
it will also provide a CLI interface for interacting with these endpoints
as client or user.

## Management

It currently is managed on two projects:
[Build AstronAuth](https://github.com/users/miniluz/projects/1/views/1)
and
[AstronAuth Requirements](https://github.com/users/miniluz/projects/2/views/1).
